          <div id="stack">
          <p> Since finishing my full stack web development immersive I've gained the skills necessary to design a full blown web application. This new craft makes me driven & eager to get my hands on new technologies to enhance user experience. Through my courses at GA, l've learned how to gather information to facilitate the planning and design of the web application process while implementing functionality though front end and back end technologies. I learned the importance of patience and rigorous testing, and the value of solid communication when working within a team.
            <p>I am proficient in a wide array of scripting languages and frameworks which include: Ruby, Rails, Javascript, jQuery, HTML, CSS, Node.js, Express, Angular, postgreSQL.</p>
            <p>At my 1st FinTech start-up, I worked on internal tools to improve the admin portal for our customer success team as a Junior Developer.
              I was involved in the product management process including wireframing, creating user stories, developing and testing features with a remote team.
